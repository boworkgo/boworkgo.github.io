I'm feeling lazy but can't afford to be. I got my own problems, finals and personal issues, but they aren't much compared with other people's. Moreover, the world has got its overwhelming share of problems that I'm obliged to take part in solving. How can I get over laziness and never have to think about this issue again so I can move onto more important problems?

My definition of laziness is not doing what I should be doing. My definition of what I should be doing is a plan with moral boundaries which prepares me best for my future. If my future is out of my control and bleak, I might as well give up now. But my future is not out of my control; it only seems like it is when put next to world issues. I still have a lot of life in me, and I'm grateful that I still have the opportunity to do lots. I'm also grateful that I watched Endgame last Thursday. A famous line in the movie was when Doctor Strange said there was a 1 in 14 million chance the heroes would defeat Thanos. It also feels like there's a 1 in 14 million chance humans will survive past 2050 without triggering a global catastrophe.

Like the fact that almost every Marvel hero was in Endgame, Lil Dicky's Earth was a monster collaboration: I don't think I've seen so many famous singers appear in a single video. It speaks about positive / negative world changes and climate change. If entertainment uses terror, it could be to sell more of it or because the world is approaching a point of urgency where even entertainment, made for humans to forget about their problems, feels like it needs to do something about them. 

I just guessed why entertainment uses terror: however, it's not possible for me to evaluate those possibilities without critical thinking. Fighting misinformation is the first stepping stone to tackling world issues, and it seemed like it couldn't solve my problem of feeling lazy at first glance. But I think it can be a start to ask probing questions about its origins. Rife with self-promoters, Google searches for 'how to deal with laziness' could contain valuable information but are loaded with poo, and it's necessary to separate the poo from the gold nuggets.

Like any essay I've written for school, this essay is useless even though I actually tried to write it well. I tried smoothening some interesting observations to a point where the essay feels like a story but the value of those observations is nothing. The glue may make the story feel more uniform, yet it degrades the quality of information presented in the essay because it's forced / made up. The sad reality is I'm actually intrigued by the original question but I feel like a rock in terms of answering it. I also connected the conclusion semi-randomly, and God help me if the future way for solving problems is connecting a database of problems to a database of solutions, with neural networks evaluating how intuitive it is to argue the solution solves the problem.
