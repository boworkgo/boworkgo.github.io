<p>One month update: I didn’t pass the OSCP on August 17. I’ll be trying again December during winter break. This semester will be the final one in which I will broaden my view of computer science and security through random projects, then I’m going to specialize in something (binary exploitation?). I’m not going to post OSCP advice until after I pass it (if I do). This is a depressing but simple and important post.</p>
